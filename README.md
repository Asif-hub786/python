1)Regular Expressions are the standard way to represent the patterns in the strings. One symbol is '+', which represents all strings that have one or more occurrences of the preceding character. Example: t+e+a+ represent any string that has a string of t's followed by a string of e's followed by a string of a's. Each of these strings of repeating letters must have atleast one character.

Get the input string and RegEx pattern. Check whether the given string matches with the RegEx Pattern.

If string matches with the pattern print Matched else print Does not match.

Input Format:

The first input contains string which denotes input string

The second input contains string which denotes RegEx pattern.

Output Format:

Check whether the given string matches with the RegEx Pattern. If string matches with the pattern print "Matched". Otherwise, print "Does not match".

Sample Input:

ttteeaab

t+e+a+b

Sample Output:

Matched




2)A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backwards as forwards. Given a palindrome write a program to print the sorted list of all palindromes that can be constructed from the alphabets of the given palindrome. All palindromes should start in a newline.

Input Format :

The first line, an integer T, indicating the number of test cases T lines each containing one string (palindrome)

Output Format :

Print sorted list of all palindromes constructed from the given palindrome of the ith test case . If the entered string is not a palindrome, then it should print as Not a palindrome.

Sample Test Case:

Sample Input:

1

NITIN

Sample Output:

INTNI

NITIN

Explanation:

There are only two palindromes that can be constructed from NITIN.
